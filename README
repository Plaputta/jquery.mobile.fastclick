Forked this nice project to make it compatible with JqueryMobile and have fast responsive buttons without ghost clicks and the annoying 300ms delay


Zepto fast buttons without nasty ghostclicks.
Supports delegation and handlers removal, though removal feels a bit hacky and needs to be tested.
Highly inspired by http://code.google.com/mobile/articles/fast_buttons.html
